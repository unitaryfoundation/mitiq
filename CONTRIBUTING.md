# Contributing to Mitiq

All contributions to this project are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated; every little bit helps.
The two most common ways to contribute here are
1. opening an [issue](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/issues/new) to report a bug or propose a new feature, or ask a question, and
2. opening a [pull request](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/pulls) to fix a bug, or implement a desired feature.

That said, feel free to open an issue to ask a question, provide general feedback, etc.

The rest of this document describes the technical details of getting set up to develop, and make your first contribution to Mitiq.


## Development environment

1. Ensure you have python 3.8 or greater installed. If not, you can find the downloads [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
2. Set up a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. This can be done with many different tools including [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). In what follows we will use Anaconda, but if you're familiar with other tools feel free to use those.
3. Set up a local version of the [Mitiq repository](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq). To do this you will need to use `git` which is a version control system. If you're unfamiliar, check out the [docs](https://git-scm.com/), and learn about what the typical [`git` workflow](https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/) looks like.
4. Inside the Mitiq repository (`cd mitiq`), activate a virtual environment. With conda this is done using the following command.
```
conda create --name myenv python=3
conda activate myenv
```
5. Install the dependencies. First, to get an updated version of [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) inside the virtual environment run `conda install pip` followed by
```
pip install -e .[development]
```
6. You should now have a development environment set up to work on Mitiq! ðŸŽ‰ To go forward with making the desired changes, please consult the ["Making changes" section](https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/#making-changes) of the `git` workflow article. If you've encountered any problems thus far, please let us know by opening an issue! More information about workflow can be found below in the [lifecycle](#lifecycle) section.

What follows are recommendations/requirements to keep in mind while contributing.

## Making changes

### Adding tests
When modifying and/or adding new code it is important to ensure the changes are covered by tests.
Test thoroughly, but not excessively.
Mitiq uses a nested structure for packaging tests in directories named `tests` at the same level of each module.
The only except to this is that any tests requiring a QVM should be placed in the `mitiq_pyquil/tests` folder.

### Running tests

After making changes, please ensure your changes pass all the existing tests (and any new tests you've added).
You can run the tests using the `pytest` CLI, but the [Makefile][makefile] contains many of the common commands you'll need to ensure your code is aligned with our standards.

For example, to run all the tests that do not require a pyQuil QVM, run
```bash
make test
```
This is typically suitable for most development tasks and is the easiest, and most common way to test.

To run the tests for the pyQuil plugins, run
```bash
make test-pyquil
```

To run all tests, run
```bash
make test-all
```

**Note**: For the pyQuil tests to run, you will need to have QVM & quilc servers
running in the background. The easiest way to do this is with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) via

```bash
docker run --rm -idt -p 5000:5000 rigetti/qvm -S
docker run --rm -idt -p 5555:5555 rigetti/quilc -R
```

If you've modified any docstrings/added new functions, run `make doctest` to ensure they are formatted correctly.
You may need to run `make docs` before you are able to run `make doctest`. 

### Updating the documentation
Follow these [instructions for contributing to the documentation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing_docs.html) which include guidelines about updating the API-doc list of modules and writing examples in the users guide.

### Style guidelines

Mitiq code is developed according the best practices of Python development.
* Please get familiar with [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (code) and [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) (docstrings) guidelines.
* Use annotations for type hints in the objects' signature.
* Write [google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods).

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and `flake8` to automatically lint the code and enforce style requirements as part of the CI pipeline.
You can run these style tests yourself locally in the top-level directory of the repository.

You can check for violations of the `flake8` rules with
```bash
make check-style
```
In order to check if `black` would reformat the code, use
```bash
make check-format
```
If above format check fails then you will be presented with a [diff](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#diffs) which can be resolved by running
```bash
make format
```
We also use [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a type checker to find incompatible types compared to the type
hints in your code. To test this locally, run the type check test in the top-level directory of the repository. 

To find incorrectly used types by type checking in `mypy`, use
```bash
make check-types
```

If you aren't presented with any errors, then that means your code is ready to commit!

## Proposing a new feature to Mitiq
If you are interested in adding a substantial new feature or functionality to Mitiq, please make a copy of our Request For Comments (RFC) [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1adomheXpbqp4YIBFQ49IsAJzuJKWyr75GRO1NeWg0Fo/) and fill out the details of your enhancement proposal.
Take a look at [previous RFCs](#list-of-accepted-rfcs) for examples on how to fill out your proposal.
Once you have completed your proposal, [create a feature request issue](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&template=feature_request.md&title=) and add a link to your proposal document (make sure to enable commenting on the RFC!).
For any part of the template that you weren't able to complete please mention that in the issue description.
