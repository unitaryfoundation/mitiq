# Contributing to mitiq

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated, every little bit helps.

## Opening an issue
You can begin contributing to `mitiq` code by raising an
[issue](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/issues/new), reporting a bug or
proposing a new feature request, using the labels to organize it.
Please use `mitiq.about()` to document your dependencies and working environment.

## Opening a pull request
You can open a [pull request](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/pulls) by pushing changes from a local branch, explaining the bug fix or new feature.

### Version control with git
git is a language that helps keeping track of the changes made. Have a look at these guidelines for getting started with [git workflow](https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/).
Use short and explanatory comments to document the changes with frequent commits.

### Forking the repository
You can fork mitiq from the github repository, so that your changes are applied with respect to the current master branch. Use the Fork button, and then use git from the command line to clone your fork of the repository locally on your machine.
```bash
(base) git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/mitiq.git
```
You can also use SSH instead of a HTTPS protocol.

### Working in a virtual environment
It is best to set up a clean environment with anaconda, to keep track of all installed applications.
```bash
(base) conda create -n myenv python=3
```
accept the configuration ([y]) and switch to the environment
```bash
(base) conda activate myenv
(myenv) conda install pip
```
Once you will finish the modifications, you can deactivate the environment with
```bash
(myenv) conda deactivate myenv
```

### Development install
In order to install all the libraries useful for contributing to the development of the library, from your local clone of the fork, run
```bash
(myenv) pip install -e .[development]
```
This command will use `pip` to read the requirements contained in `requirements.txt` and `development_requirements.txt`

### Adding tests
If you add new features to a function or class, it is strongly encouraged to add tests for such object. Mitiq uses a nested structure for packaging tests in directories named `tests` at the same level of each module.

### Updating the documentation
Follow the guidelines in the Contributing to docs [instructions](docs/build/read_README-docs.rst) (look here on [GitHub](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/blob/master/docs/README-docs.md)), which include guidelines about updating the API-doc list of modules and writing examples in the users guide.

### Checking local tests
You can check that tests run with `pytest`. The `test_build.sh` file contains some bash commands to automate all tests. If you added new test packages, add them there too, so that they will be tested also in continuous integration. To test this run from root
```bash
(myenv) ./test_build.sh
```

You can check that all tests run also in the documentation examples and docstrings with

```bash
./test_build.sh -docs
```

### Code style
Mitiq code is developed according the best practices of Python development.
* Please get familiar with [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (code) and [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) (docstrings) guidelines.
* You can use [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) code formatter to implement some PEP 8 and PEP 257 rules. For example, line length limit is 79 characters.
* Use annotations for type hints in the objects' signature.
* Write google-style docstrings.

### Code of conduct
Mitiq development abides to the [Contrutors' Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
