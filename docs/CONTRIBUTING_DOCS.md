## Requirements
Our documentation is generated with
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html).
The necessary packages can be installed, from the root Mitiq directory
```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
```
as they are included in the `dev_requirements.txt` file.
Alternately, you can use the docker image provided in the repo and all requirements for working with the docs are already installed there.

### Sphinx extensions used to build the docs
- [`myst-nb`](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [`myst-parser`](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allow both markdown and jupyter notebooks to be included and run by the Sphinx build. Also adds support for [MyST markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/syntax.html) spec.
- [`sphinxcontrib-bibtex`](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows to include citations in a `.bib` file.
- [`pybtex`](https://pybtex.org/) allows to customize how citations are rendered, e.g., APS-style.
- [`sphinx-copybutton`](https://sphinx-copybutton.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows to easily copy-paste code snippets from examples.
- [`sphinx-autodoc-typehints`](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autodoc-typehints/) allows to control how annotations are displayed in the API-doc part of the documentation, integrating with  [`sphinx-autodoc`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) and [`sphinx-napoleon`](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which handle specific styling requirements for the API documentation comments.

You can check that Sphinx is installed with `sphinx-build --version`.

### The configuration file
Since the documentation is already created, you need not to generate a
configuration file from scratch (this is done with `sphinx-quickstart`).
Meta-data, extensions and other custom specifications are accounted for
in the `conf.py` file.

### Add/change Sphinx features in the conf.py file

To add specific feature to the documentation, Sphinx extensions can be added to the build.
As and example, to add classes and functions to the API doc, make sure that autodoc
extension is enabled in the `conf.py` file, and for tests the `doctest` one,

```python
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc','sphinx.ext.doctest']
```

## Updating the Documentation

You need not to modify the `docs/build` folder, as it is automatically generated. You should only modify the `docs/source` files.

The documentation is divided into:
-  a **guide**, whose content needs to be
written from scratch, 
- **examples** which can be either jupyter notebooks or MyST formatted notebooks, and
- an **API-doc** part, which is (mostly)
automatically generated.

Information in the docs can be added as markdown (`.md`/`.myst`) files, since
the `myst-parser` extension supports both basic markdown syntax as well as
the extended MyST syntax. Just add the file to `source` directory and a TOC somewhere (if you want that).

```{warning}
Currently, `.rst` is supported for any of the files in the docs, but the current migration plan is to move everything to MyST serialization, to make it easier to include Jupyter notebooks and more consistent with documentation in the project root.
If you want a good intro to MyST and how it compares to `.rst` see [this guide](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/intro.html#intro-writing).
```

The main table of contents (TOC) file for the docs is `index.myst`. It includes `guide\guide.myst` and `apidoc.myst`, among other files. To add a new file to the base TOC, make sure it gets listed in the `toctree` directive like this:
````
```{toctree}
---
maxdepth: 2 
caption: Contents
---
file.myst
```
````

```{tip}
If you use VS Code as your text editor there is a nice extension that does syntax highlighting for MyST: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExecutableBookProject.myst-highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExecutableBookProject.myst-highlight)
```
### Including other files in the docs 

To include `.md` files outside of the documentation `source` directory, you can add a stub `*.myst` file to the toctree inside the `docs\source` directory that contains:

````
```{include} path/to/file.md
:relative-docs: docs/
:relative-images:
```
````

where `file.md` is the one to be added. For more information on including files external to the docs, see the [MyST docs](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/howto.html#include-a-file-from-outside-the-docs-folder-like-readme-md).

### Adding files to the user guide

To add information in the guide, it is recommended to add markdown (`.md`) or MyST markdown files (`.myst`) to the `docs/guide/` directory.
Remember to add any files you add to the `docs/guide/` directory to the guide TOC file `docs/source/guide/guide.myst`.

### Adding code examples

All code examples, besides explanations on the use of core software package features, live in the `examples` directory under `docs/source`. You can add regular
Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or MyST formatted markdown notebooks (`.myst` or `.md`) which you can think of as notebooks if you could write them in markdown.
In general MyST formatting will be preferred as it is much easier to diff in version control, but adds one additional step for folks contributing them directly.

If you have a notebook you want to add, and want to automatically convert it from the `.ipynb` to the `.myst` file format, you can use a great Python command line tool called [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
Not only can `jupytext` convert between the formats on demand, but once you install it, you can configure it to manage _both_ a Jupyter and Markdown version of your file, so you don't have to remember to do conversions (for more details, see the `jupytext` docs on [paired notebooks](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#paired-notebooks).
Using the paired notebooks you can continue your development in the notebooks as normal, and just commit to git the markdown serialized version when you want to add to the docs.
You can even add this tool as a [git pre-commit hook](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-pre-commit.html) if you want!

```{tip}
There is a sample markdown formatted notebook in the `examples` directory for you to take a look at as you write your own!
```

### Automatically add information from the API docs

New modules, classes and functions can be added by listing them
in the appropriate `.md or `*.myst` file (such as `apidoc.myst` or a child), e.g.,

```
## New Module
```{automodule} mitiq.new_module
   :members:
```
will add all elements of the `mitiq.new_module` module with a subtitle "New Module." 
You can hand-pick classes and functions to add, to comment them, as well as exclude them.

```{tip}
If you are adding new features to Mitiq, make sure to add API docs in the
source code, and to the API page `apidoc.rst`.
```

### Build the documentation locally
The easiest way to build the docs is to just run `make docs` from the project 
root directory in bash, which by default builds the html docs output.
You can also use from root `make pdf` to generate the PDF version.

```{tip}
If you want to remove previous builds and make the HTML docs fresh, try `make docs-clean`!
```

If you want to call sphinx directly, you can from bash move to the `docs` 
folder and run

```bash
sphinx-build -b html source build

```
this generates the `docs/build` folder. This folder is not kept track of in the
github repository, as `docs/build` is present in the `.gitignore` file.

```{note}
The `html` and `latex` and `pdf` files will be automatically created in the
`docs/build` folder.
```

## Testing the Documentation 

When writing a new code example in the docs, you can use different directives 
to include code blocks. 

### Just the code, don't evaluate
If you want to include a code snippet that doesn't get run (but has syntax
highlighting), use the `code-block` directive:

````
```{code-block} python

   1+1        # simple example
```
````
### Run the code with doctest
In order to make sure that the block is parsed with `make doctest`, use the
`testcode` directive. This can be used in pair with `testoutput`, if something
is printed, and, eventually `testsetup`, to import modules or set up variables
in an invisible block. An example is:

````
```{testcode} python

   1+1        # simple example
```
````
with no output and

````
```{testcode} python
   print(1+1)        # explicitly print
```

```{testoutput} python
   2        # match the print message
```
````

If you have code blocks you want to run, but not be displayed, use the 
`testsetup` directive:

````
```{testsetup} python
   import numpy as np  # this block is not rendered in the html or pdf
```

```{testcode} python
   np.array(2)
```

```{testoutput} python
   array(2)
```
````
### IPython code blocks
There is also the `doctest` directive, which allows you to include interactive
Python blocks. These need to be given this way:

````md
```{doctest} python
   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> print(np.array(2))
   array(2)
```
````
```{note}
Notice that no space is left between the last input and the output when writing code blocks with interactive inputs and outputs.
```

### Skipping or ignoring a test

In order to skip a test, if this is problematic, one can use the `SKIP` and
`IGNORE` keywords, adding them as comments next to the relevant line or block:

```
>>> something_that_raises()  #: doctest: +IGNORE
```

### Running the tests

Mitiq uses the `doctest` [extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html) to run and test code in the docs, which is configured in the `conf.py` file. To execute the tests in bash, run:

```bash
make doctest
```
from the root directory. 

This command tests the code examples in the documentation files, as well as testing the docstrings, since these are imported with the `autodoc` extension.

One can also use various `doctest` [features](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.html#using-doctest-options) by configuring them in the
`docs/pytest.ini` file.
