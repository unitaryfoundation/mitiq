# Mitiq Enhancement Proposal 0002 â€” Full Twirling and Reduced Twirling

## Abstract
---
#### Checklist before submission
- [ ] Short description of what is proposed

Pauli Twirling or Clifford Twirling is used to convert a known error channel into Pauli error channel. Full twirling uses entire set of error operators whereas reduced twirling is based in finding generators of error operator set.

## Motivation and Scope
---
#### Checklist before submission
- [ ] Describe the need for proposed change - Gottesman-Knill Theorem
- [ ] Proposed change describes the existing problem
- [ ] What does the change affect
- [ ] What is the change trying to solve
- [ ] Address scope and key requirements for
the proposed change

#### Full Twirling

#### Reduced Twirling

## Usage and Impact

This section should list relevant and/or similar technologies, possibly in other
libraries. It does not need to be comprehensive, just list the major examples of
prior and relevant art.

## Implementation
---
#### Checklist before submission
- [ ] List the major steps required to implement the MEP
- [ ] Note where one step is dependent on another
- [ ] Note which steps could be omitted


Any pull requests or development branches containing work on this MEP should
be linked to from here.  (A MEP does not need to be implemented in a single
pull request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases).

## Alternatives
---

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem, they should
be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen approach.
