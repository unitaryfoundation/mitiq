    "# Improving the accuracy of BQSKit compiled circuits with error mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we describe how to use error mitigation capabilities from [Mitiq](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) together with the compilation capabilities of [BQSKit](https://bqskit.lbl.gov/), a compiler for quantum circuits. BQSKit stands for Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit and it allows one \"to compile quantum programs to efficient physical circuits for any QPU\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, ensure you have the requisite python packages by running the following install commands.\n",
    "- `pip install mitiq`\n",
    "- `pip install bqskit==0.3.0` (here we use an older version of `bqskit` to satisfy version requirements between the two packages)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this tutorial is to understand how to use `bqskit` together with `mitiq`.\n",
    "To do this, we will\n",
    "1. generate a random circuit,\n",
    "2. compile it with `bqskit`,\n",
    "3. use error mitigation on the compiled circuit, and\n",
    "4. compare the results obtained with and without error mitigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After demonstrating the use of the two packages, we can then try and understand how circuit compilation with BQSKit in general interacts with error mitigation by running the process many times and comparing results.\n",
