# CDR with Qrack as Near-Clifford Simulator

In this tutorial, [Clifford Data Regression](../guide/cdr.md) (CDR) is used with [Qrack](https://qrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and a Qiskit fake backend.

+++

## Setup

To start, relevant modules and libraries are imported. Please ensure that the following Python modules are installed: `mitiq`, `numpy`, `pyqrack`, `cirq`, `qiskit`

+++

```{note}
In the code below the environmental variable, `QRACK_MAX_CPU_QB`, is set to `-1`. This enviroment variable sets the maximum on how many qubits can be allocated on a single QEngineCPU instance. More information can be found on the [Qrack README page](https://github.com/unitaryfund/qrack/blob/main/README.md#maximum-allocation-guard).
```

```{code-cell}
import numpy as np
import collections

import os
import warnings
warnings.simplefilter("ignore", np.ComplexWarning)

from pyqrack import QrackSimulator, QrackCircuit
os.environ["QRACK_MAX_CPU_QB"]="-1"

import mitiq.interface.mitiq_qiskit
from mitiq.interface.mitiq_cirq import compute_density_matrix
from mitiq import cdr, Observable, PauliString

import cirq

from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import Fake5QV1
```

## Sample Circuit

This sample circuit includes Clifford gates (`H`, `CNOT`, `RX`) and non-Clifford gates (`RZ`).

```{code-cell}
a, b = cirq.LineQubit.range(2)
circuit = cirq.Circuit(
    cirq.H.on(a),  # Clifford
    cirq.H.on(b),  # Clifford
    cirq.rz(1.75).on(a),
    cirq.rz(2.31).on(b),
    cirq.CNOT.on(a, b),  # Clifford
    cirq.rz(-1.17).on(b),
    cirq.rz(3.23).on(a),
    cirq.rx(np.pi / 2).on(a),  # Clifford
    cirq.rx(np.pi / 2).on(b),  # Clifford
)

# CDR works better if the circuit is not too short. So we increase its depth.
circuit = 5 * circuit
print(circuit)
```

## Devices and Near-Clifford Simulator

During CDR, near-Clifford representations of the original circuit are generated. Those near-Clifford representations are run with a near-Clifford simulator (Qrack Near-Clifford Simulator) and also on the quantum device (or noisy simulator, like Qiskit Fake Backend.) In this example, we also want to show how the unmitigated and mitigated results compare to the exact results, so we will use another simulator (Cirq Simulator) to generate the ideal results. 

+++

### Qrack Near-Clifford Simulator

Especially when using CDR at scale, it is important to use an efficient Near-Clifford circuit simulator. In this example, Qrack will be configured and used as the Near-Clifford Simulator. The `qrack_simulate` method accepts a Cirq circuit and the number of shots as parameters. The Qrack simulator is then called and the expectation value for `00` is returned.

Since CDR includes the generation of near-Clifford circuits representing the original circuit, a near-Clifford simulator is ideal for efficiently simulating the circuit. Again, this is particularly important when using CDR at scale.

```{code-cell}
def qrack_simulate(circuit: cirq.Circuit, shots=1000) -> float:
    """Returns the expectation value of 00 from the state prepared by the circuit
    executed without noise by Qrack configured as a near-Clifford simulator.
    """

    # Cirq -> Qiskit circuit
    qiskit_circ = mitiq.interface.mitiq_qiskit.to_qiskit(circuit)

    # Qiskit -> Qrack circuit
    qcircuit = QrackCircuit.in_from_qiskit_circuit(qiskit_circ) 

    # Setup the Qrack simulator and run it
    qsim = QrackSimulator(qiskit_circ.width(), isStabilizerHybrid=True, isTensorNetwork=False, isSchmidtDecomposeMulti=False, isSchmidtDecompose=False, isOpenCL=False)
    qcircuit.run(qsim)

    # Use shot measurements to return the expectation value of 00
    results = qsim.measure_shots(q=list(range(qiskit_circ.width())), s=shots)
    results = dict(collections.Counter(results))
    for key, value in results.items():
        results[key] = value / shots
    return results[0]
```

### Qiskit Fake Backend

CDR requires the use of a quantum device or a noisy simulator. The near-Clifford circuits that are generated from the original circuit are executed on the quantum device or noisy simulator in order to compare against the simulated results.

In this example, a Qiskit 5 Qubit Fake Backend is used. The [Fake5QV1](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.providers.fake_provider.Fake5QV1) uses configurations and noise settings taken previously from the 5 qubit IBM Quantum Yorktown device. The `qiskit_noisy` function takes the Cirq circuit and uses Mitiq to change it into a Qiskit circuit. After adding measurements, the circuit is run on the fake backend. The expectation value for `00` is then returned.

```{code-cell}
# Use Qiskit's Fave5QV1 as a noisy simulator
def qiskit_noisy(circuit: cirq.Circuit, shots=1000):
    """Execute the input circuit and return the expectation value of |00..0><00..0|"""

    # Cirq -> Qiskit circuit
    qiskit_circ = mitiq.interface.mitiq_qiskit.to_qiskit(circuit)

    # Add measurement gates to the circuit
    qiskit_circ.measure_all()

    # Setup the fake backend and run the circuit
    noisy_backend = Fake5QV1()
    job = noisy_backend.run(qiskit_circ, shots=shots)

    # Use the resulting counts to return the expectation value of 00
    counts = job.result().get_counts()
    ret_val =  counts[qiskit_circ.num_qubits * "0"] / shots
    return ret_val
```

### Cirq Simulator for exact result

The `compute_density_matrix` is the Cirq density matrix simulator with a Mitiq wrapper. It is used to obtain the exact `00` expectation value. This is then used to determine the accuracy of the mitigated and unmitigated reuslts.

```{code-cell}
def cirq_simulate(circuit: cirq.Circuit) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns Tr[ρ |0⟩⟨0|] where ρ is the state prepared by the circuit 
    executed without depolarizing noise.
    """
    res = compute_density_matrix(circuit, noise_level=(0.0,))
    return res[0, 0].real
```

## Executing CDR

With the different executor functions defined for running the Qrack, Qiskit, and Cirq simulators, the `mitiq.cdr.execute_with_cdr` function can now be called.

```{code-cell}
ideal_expval = cirq_simulate(circuit).round(5)
print(f"Ideal expectation value from Cirq Simulator: {ideal_expval:.3f}")

unmitigated_expval = qiskit_noisy(circuit)
print(f"Unmitigated expectation value from Qiskit Fake backend: {unmitigated_expval:.3f}")

mitigated_expval = cdr.execute_with_cdr(
    circuit,
    qiskit_noisy,
    simulator=qrack_simulate,
    random_state=0,
)
print(f"Mitigated expectation value with Mitiq CDR: {mitigated_expval:.3f}\n")

```

## Conclusion
By learning from the near-Clifford circuits that resemble the original circuit, CDR is able to apply the noise information learned to the original circuit. From the example, you can see that the mitigated expectation value is closer to the ideal value.

The improvement factor with CDR can be seen below to highlight the mitigated results that can be provided with this technique.

```{code-cell}
unmitigated_error = abs(unmitigated_expval - ideal_expval)
mitigated_error = abs(mitigated_expval - ideal_expval)

print(f"Unmitigated Error:           {unmitigated_error:.3f}")
print(f"Mitigated Error:             {mitigated_error:.3f}")

improvement_factor = unmitigated_error / mitigated_error
print(f"Improvement factor with CDR: {improvement_factor:.2f}")
```
