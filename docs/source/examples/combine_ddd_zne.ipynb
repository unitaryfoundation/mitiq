    "# Composing techniques: Digital Dynamical Decoupling and Zero Noise Extrapolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise in quantum computers can arise from a variety of sources, and sometimes applying multiple error mitigation techniques can be more beneficial than applying a single technique alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we apply a combination of Digital Dynamical Decoupling (DDD) and Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) to a randomized benchmarking (RB) task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [DDD](../guide/ddd.md), the input quantum circuit is modified by adding in gate sequences at regular intervals designed to reduce interaction between (i.e., decouple) the qubits from their environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [ZNE](../guide/zne.md), the expectation value of the observable of interest is computed at different noise levels, and subsequently the ideal expectation value is inferred by extrapolating the measured results to the zero-noise\n",
    "limit. \n",
