# ZNE with Qiskit: Layerwise folding


This tutorial shows an example of how to mitigate noise on IBMQ backends using
layerwise folding in contrast with global folding.

One may ask why folding by layer is potentially beneficial to consider. One
reason is that applying global folding will increase the length of the entire
circuit while layerwise folding on a subset of only the noisiest layers will
increase the circuit by a smaller factor. 

If running a circuit on hardware is bottle-necked by the cost of running a long
circuit, this technique could potentially be used to arrive at a better result
(although not as good as global folding) but with less monetary cost.

More information on the layerwise folding technique can be found in 
*Calderon et al. Quantum (2023)* {cite}`Calderon_2023_Quantum`.

## Setup

```{code-cell} ipython3
from typing import Dict, List, Optional
import numpy as np
import os
import cirq
import qiskit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from mitiq import zne
from mitiq.zne.scaling.layer_scaling import layer_folding, get_layer_folding
from mitiq.interface.mitiq_qiskit.qiskit_utils import initialized_depolarizing_noise
from mitiq.interface.mitiq_qiskit.conversions import to_qiskit
from mitiq.interface.mitiq_cirq.cirq_utils import sample_bitstrings

from cirq.contrib.svg import SVGCircuit
from qiskit_aer import QasmSimulator
from qiskit_ibm_provider import IBMProvider

# Default to a simulator.
noise_model = initialized_depolarizing_noise(noise_level=0.02)
backend = QasmSimulator(noise_model=noise_model)

shots = 10_000
```

## Helper functions

The following function will return a list of circuits where the ith element in
the list is a circuit with layer "i" folded `num_folds` number of times. This
will be useful when analyzing how much folding increases the noise on a given
layer.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def apply_num_folds_to_all_layers(circuit: cirq.Circuit, num_folds: int = 1) -> List[cirq.Circuit]:
    """List of circuits where ith circuit is folded `num_folds` times."""
    return [
        layer_folding(circuit, [0] * i + [num_folds] + [0] * (len(circuit) - i))
        for i in range(len(circuit))
    ]
```

For instance, consider the following circuit.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Define a basic circuit for
q0, q1 = cirq.LineQubit.range(2)
circuit = cirq.Circuit(
    [cirq.ops.H(q0)],
    [cirq.ops.CNOT(q0, q1)],
    [cirq.measure(cirq.LineQubit(0))],
)
print(circuit)
```

Let us invoke the `apply_num_folds_to_all_layers` function as follows.

```{code-cell} ipython3
folded_circuits = apply_num_folds_to_all_layers(circuit, num_folds=2)
```

Note that the first element of the list is the circuit with the first layer of
the circuit folded twice.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(folded_circuits[0])
```

Similarly, the second element of the list is the circuit with the second layer
folded.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(folded_circuits[1])
```

## Define circuit to analyze

We will use the following circuit to analyze, but of course, you could use
other circuits here as well.

```{code-cell} ipython3
circuit = cirq.Circuit([cirq.X(cirq.LineQubit(0))] * 10, cirq.measure(cirq.LineQubit(0)))
print(circuit)
```

## Total variational distance metric

An $i$-inversion can be viewed as a local perturbation of the circuit. We want
to define some measure by which we can determine how much such a perturbation
affects the outcome.

Define the quantity:

$$
p(k|C) = \langle \langle k | C | \rho_0 \rangle \rangle
$$

as the probability distribution over measurement outcomes at the output of a
circuit $C$ where $k \in B^n$ with $B^n$ being the set of all $n$-length bit
strings where $\langle \langle k |$ is the vectorized POVM element that
corresponds to measuring bit string $k$. 

The *impact* of applying an inversion is given by

$$
d \left[p(\cdot|C), p(\cdot|C^{(i)})\right]
$$

where $d$ is some distance measure. In 
*Calderon et al. Quantum (2023)* {cite}`Calderon_2023_Quantum` the authors used the total variational distance
(TVD) measure where

$$
\eta^{(i)} := \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k} |p(k|C) - p(k|C^{(i)})|.
$$

```{code-cell} ipython3
def tvd(circuit: cirq.Circuit, num_folds: int = 1, shots: int = 10_000) -> List[float]:
    """Compute the total variational distance (TVD) between ideal circuit and folded circuit(s)."""
    circuit_dist = sample_bitstrings(circuit=circuit, shots=shots).prob_distribution()

    folded_circuits = apply_num_folds_to_all_layers(circuit, num_folds)

    distances: Dict[int, float] = {}
    for i, folded_circuit in enumerate(folded_circuits):
        folded_circuit_dist = sample_bitstrings(circuit=folded_circuit, shots=shots).prob_distribution()

        res: float = 0.0
        for bitstring in circuit_dist.keys():
            res += np.abs(circuit_dist[bitstring] - folded_circuit_dist[bitstring])
        distances[i] = res / 2

    return distances
```

## Impact of single vs. multiple folding 

We can plot the impact of applying layer inversions to the circuit.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def plot_single_vs_multiple_folding(circuit: cirq.Circuit) -> None:
    """Plot how single vs. multiple folding impact the error at a given layer."""
    single_tvd = tvd(circuit, num_folds=1).values()
    multiple_tvd = tvd(circuit, num_folds=5).values()

    labels = [f"L{i}" for i in range(len(circuit))]
    x = np.arange(len(labels))  # the label locations
    width = 0.35  # the width of the bars

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    rects1 = ax.bar(x - width/2, single_tvd, width, label="single")
    rects2 = ax.bar(x + width/2, multiple_tvd, width, label="multiple")

    # Add some text for labels, title and custom x-axis tick labels, etc.
    ax.set_xlabel(r"$L_{G_i \theta_i}$")
    ax.set_ylabel(r"$\eta^{(i)}$")
    ax.set_title("Single vs. multiple folding")
    ax.set_xticks(x, labels, rotation=60)

    ax.legend()

    ax.bar_label(rects1, padding=3)
    ax.bar_label(rects2, padding=3)

    fig.tight_layout()

    plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_single_vs_multiple_folding(circuit)
```

As can be seen, the amount of noise on each layer is increased if the number of
folds on that layer are increased.

## Executor

Next, we define an executor function that will allow us to run our experiment

```{code-cell} ipython3
def executor(circuit: cirq.Circuit, shots: int = 10_000) -> float:
    """Returns the expectation value to be mitigated.

    Args:
        circuit: Circuit to run.
        shots: Number of times to execute the circuit to compute the expectation value.
    """
    qiskit_circuit = to_qiskit(circuit)

    # Transpile the circuit so it can be properly run
    exec_circuit = qiskit.transpile(
        qiskit_circuit,
        backend=backend,
        basis_gates=noise_model.basis_gates if noise_model else None,
        optimization_level=0, # Important to preserve folded gates.
    )
    # Run the circuit
    job = backend.run(exec_circuit, shots=shots)

    # Convert from raw measurement counts to the expectation value
    counts = job.result().get_counts()

    expectation_value = 0.0 if counts.get("0") is None else counts.get("0") / shots
    return expectation_value
```

## Global folding with linear extrapolation

First, for comparison, we apply ZNE with global folding on the entire circuit.
We then compare the mitigated result of applying ZNE with linear extrapolation
against the unmitigated value.

```{code-cell} ipython3
unmitigated = executor(circuit)

linear_factory = zne.inference.LinearFactory(scale_factors=[1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0])
mitigated = zne.execute_with_zne(circuit, executor, factory=linear_factory)

print(f"Unmitigated result {unmitigated:.3f}")
print(f"Mitigated result {mitigated:.3f}")
```

## Layerwise folding with linear extrapolation

For contrast, we apply layerwise folding on only the layer with the most noise
and use linear extrapolation. As above, we compare the mitigated and
unmitigated values.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Calculate the TVDs of each layer in the circuit (with `num_folds=3`):
tvds = tvd(circuit, num_folds=3)

# Fold noisiest layer only.
layer_to_fold = max(tvds, key=tvds.get)
fold_layer_func = zne.scaling.get_layer_folding(layer_to_fold)

mitigated = zne.execute_with_zne(circuit, executor, scale_noise=fold_layer_func, factory=linear_factory)
print(f"Mitigated (layerwise folding) result {mitigated:.3f}")
print(f"Unmitigated result {unmitigated:.3f}")
```

```{note}
While doing layerwise folding on the noisiest layer will, on average,
improve the mitigated value, it still will not eclipse the benefit of doing
global folding.
```
