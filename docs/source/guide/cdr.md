# Clifford Data Regression

Clifford data regression (CDR) is a learning-based quantum error mitigation technique in which an error mitigation model is trained with quantum circuits that _resemble_ the circuit of interest, but which are easier to classically simulate {cite}`Czarnik_2021_Quantum, Lowe_2021_PRR`.
