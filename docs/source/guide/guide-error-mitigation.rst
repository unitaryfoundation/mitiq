---------------------------------
What is quantum error mitigation?
---------------------------------

Quantum error mitigation refers to a series of techniques aimed at
reducing (*mitigating*) the errors that occur in quantum computing algorithms.
Unlike software bugs affecting code in usual computers, the errors which we
attempt to reduce with mitigation are due to the hardware.

Quantum error mitigation techniques try to *reduce* the impact of noise in
quantum computations. They generally do not completely remove it. Alternative 
nomenclature refers to error mitigation as (approximate) error suppression or 
approximate quantum error correction, but it is worth noting that error mitigation
is distinctly different from :ref:`error correction <guide_qem_qec>`. Two leading
error mitigation techniques implemented in Mitiq are zero-noise extrapolation
and probabilistic error cancellation.

.. _guide_qem_zne:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Zero-noise extrapolation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Mitiq, zero-noise extrapolation is implemented in the module :mod:`mitiq.zne`.

The crucial idea behind zero-noise extrapolation is that, although some minimum
noise strength quantified :math:`\lambda` exists in the computer,
it is possible to *increase* the noise to :math:`\lambda'=c\lambda` where :math:`c>1`.
In Mitiq, noise-scaling methods are contained in :mod:`mitiq.zne.scaling`. After computing
the observable of interest at increased noise levels, we can fit a trend to this data and
extrapolate to the zero-noise limit. In Mitiq, extrapolation (or inference) methods are
contained in :mod:`mitiq.zne.inference`.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Limitations of zero-noise extrapolation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While zero-noise extrapolation is very general and can be applied even if
the underlying noise model is unknown, the method can be sensitive to
extrapolation errors. For this reason, it is important to choose a good
noise-scaling method, set of scale factors, and extrapolation method, which
*a priori* may not be known. Moreover, one has to take into account that any
initial error in the measured expectation values will propagate to the extrapolated
value. This fact can significantly amplify the statistical uncertainty of the result.

.. _guide_qem_pec:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Probabilistic error cancellation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Mitiq, probabilistic error cancellation is implemented in the module :mod:`mitiq.pec`.

Probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) uses a quasi-probability representation :cite:`Temme_2017_PRL`
to express an ideal (unitary) quantum channel as a linear combination of noisy operations.
Given a set of noisy but implementable operations :math:`\Omega = \{O_1, \dots, O_m\}`, an
ideal unitary gate can be expressed as
:math:`\mathcal{G} = \sum_{\alpha} \eta_{\alpha} \mathcal{O}_\alpha = \gamma \sum_{\alpha} P(\alpha) \sigma(\alpha) \mathcal{O}_\alpha`,
where :math:`\eta_\alpha` are real coefficients, :math:`\gamma = \sum_{\alpha} |\eta_\alpha|`,
:math:`P(\alpha)=|\eta_\alpha | /\gamma` is a probability distribution,
and :math:`\sigma(\alpha)={\rm sign}(\eta_\alpha)`.

As usual, we want to estimate the ideal expectation value of some observable
of interest :math:`\langle X\rangle_{\text{ideal}}` after the action of an ideal circuit
:math:`\{\mathcal{\mathcal G}_i\}_{i=1}^L`. To do this in PEC, we sample a noisy operation
:math:`\mathcal{O}_{\alpha}` for each ideal gate :math:`\mathcal{G}_i`
with probability :math:`P_i(\alpha)`. This sampling produces a sequence of noisy operations
:math:`\{\mathcal{O}_{\alpha_i}\}_{i=1}^L`) whose execution produces the
final mixed state :math:`\rho_f`. Then, by measuring the observable :math:`X`, setting
:math:`\gamma_{\text{tot}} := \prod_{i}^L \gamma_i` and
:math:`\sigma_{\text{tot}} = \prod_{i=1}^L \sigma_i(\alpha)`, we can obtain an unbiased
estimate of the ideal expectation value as
:math:`\langleX\rangle_{\text{ideal}} =  \mathbb E \left[ \gamma_{\text{tot}} \sigma_{\text{tot}} X_{\rm noisy} \right]`,
where :math:`X_{\rm noisy}` is the experimental estimate of :math:`{\rm tr}[\rho_f X]`
and :math:`\mathbb E` is the sample average over many repetitions of the previous procedure.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Limitations of probabilistic error cancellation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of samples required to estimate the ideal expectation value with error
:math:`\delta` and probability :math:`1-\epsilon` scales as
:math:`\left(2 \gamma_{\text{tot}}^{2} / \delta^{2}\right) \log (2 / \epsilon)`
:cite:`Takagi2020optimal`. Thus, the sampling overhead is determined
by :math:`\gamma_{\text{tot}}` which grows exponentially in the number of gates.
It is then crucial to find a linear decomposition that minimizes :math:`\gamma_{\text{tot}}`.
In addition, a full characterization of the noisy operations up to a good precision
is required, which can be costly depending on the implementation.

Other error mitigation techniques
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A collection of references on additional error mitigation techniques,
including randomized compiling or subspace expansion, can be found in
:ref:`guide_qem_articles`.

.. _guide_qem_why:

------------------------------------------
Why is quantum error mitigation important?
------------------------------------------

The noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is characterized by
short-depth circuits in which noise affects state
preparation, gate operations, and measurement :cite:`Preskill_2018_Quantum`.
It is not possible to implement quantum error correcting codes on them due to the
needed qubit number and circuit depth required by these codes. Error mitigation
offers low-overhead methods to more accurately and reliably estimate observable values.

Mitiq aims at providing a comprehensive, flexible, and performant toolchain for
error mitigation techniques to increase the performance of NISQ computers.

.. _guide_qem_related:

--------------------------------------------------
Related fields
--------------------------------------------------

Quantum error mitigation is connected to quantum error correction and quantum
optimal control, two fields of study that also aim at reducing the impact of
errors in quantum information processing in quantum computers. While these are
fluid boundaries, it can be useful to point out some differences among these
two well-established fields and the emerging field of quantum error mitigation.

It is fair to say that even the terminology of "quantum error mitigation" or
"error mitigation" has only recently coalesced (from ~2015 onward), while even
in the previous decade similar concepts or techniques were scattered across
these and other fields. Suggestions for additional references are `welcome`_.

.. _guide_qem_qec:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Quantum error correction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Quantum error correction is different from quantum error mitigation, as it
introduces a series of techniques that generally aim at completely *removing*
the impact of errors on quantum computations. In particular, if errors
occurs below a certain threshold, the robustness of the quantum computation can
be preserved, and fault tolerance is reached.

The main issue of quantum error correction techniques are that generally they
require a large overhead in terms of additional qubits on top of those required
for the quantum computation. Current quantum computing devices have been able
to demonstrate quantum error correction only with a very small number of
qubits. What is now referred quantum error mitigation is generally a series of
techniques that stemmed as more practical quantum error correction solutions
:cite:`Knill_2005_Nature`.

.. _guide_qem_qoc:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Quantum optimal control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Optimal control theory is a very versatile set of techniques that can be
applied for many scopes. It entails many fields, and it is generally based on a
feedback loop between an agent and a target system.
Optimal control is applied to several quantum technologies,
including in the pulse shaping of gate design in quantum circuits calibration
against noisy devices :cite:`Brif_2010_NJP`.

A key difference between some quantum error mitigation techniques and quantum
optimal control is that the former can be implemented in some instances with
post-processing techniques, while the latter relies on an active feedback loop.
An example of a specific application of optimal control to quantum dynamics that
can be seen as a quantum error mitigation technique, is in dynamical decoupling
:cite:`Viola_1999_PRL`. This technique employs fast control pulses to effectively
decouple a system from its environment, with techniques pioneered in the nuclear
magnetic resonance community.

.. _guide_qem_noise:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open quantum systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

More in general, quantum computing devices can be studied in the framework of
open quantum systems :cite:`Carmichael_1999_Springer,Carmichael_2007_Springer,Gardiner_2004_Springer,Breuer_2007_Oxford`,
that is, systems that exchange energy and information with the surrounding
environment. On the one hand, the qubit-environment exchange can be controlled,
and this feature is actually fundamental to extract information and process it.
On the other hand, when this interaction is not controlled — and at the fundamental
level it cannot be completely suppressed — noise eventually kicks in, thus introducing
errors that are disruptive for the *fidelity* of the information-processing protocols.

Indeed, a series of issues arise when someone wants to perform a calculation on a
quantum computer. This is due to the fact that quantum computers are devices that
are embedded in an environment and interact with it. This means that stored information
can be corrupted, or that, during calculations, the protocols are not faithful.

Errors occur for a series of reasons in quantum computers and the microscopic
description at the physical level can vary broadly, depending on the quantum
computing platform that is used, as well as the computing architecture. For example,
superconducting-circuit-based quantum computers have chips that
are prone to cross-talk noise, while qubits encoded in trapped ions need to be
shuttled with electromagnetic pulses, and solid-state artificial atoms, including
quantum dots, are heavily affected by inhomogeneous broadening :cite:`Buluta_2011_RPP`.
