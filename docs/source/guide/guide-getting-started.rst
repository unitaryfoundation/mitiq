Getting Started

Improving the performance of your quantum programs is only a few lines of
code away.

Here's an example using
`cirq <https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_. We'll test
``mitiq`` by running against the noisy simulator built into ``cirq``.

We first define some functions that make it simpler to simulate noise in
``cirq``. These don't have to do with ``mitiq`` directly.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from cirq import Circuit, depolarize, LineQubit, X, DensityMatrixSimulator

    SIMULATOR = DensityMatrixSimulator()

    # 0.1% depolarizing noise
    NOISE = 0.001


    def noisy_simulation(circ: Circuit, shots=None) -> float:
        """ Simulates a circuit with depolarizing noise at level NOISE.

        Args:
            circ: The quantum program as a cirq object.
            shots: This unused parameter is needed to match mitiq's expected type
                   signature for an executor function.

        Returns:
            The observable's measurements as as
            tuple (expectation value, variance).
        """
        circuit = circ.with_noise(depolarize(p=NOISE))
        rho = SIMULATOR.simulate(circuit).final_density_matrix
        # define the computational basis observable
        obs = np.diag([1, 0])
        expectation = np.real(np.trace(rho @ obs))
        return expectation

Now we can look at our example. We'll test single qubit circuits with even
numbers of X gates. As there are an even number of X gates, they should all
evaluate to an expectation of 1 in the computational basis if there was no
noise.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> qbit = LineQubit(0)
    >>> circ = Circuit(X(qbit) for _ in range(80))

    >>> unmitigated = noisy_simulation(circ)
    >>> exact = 1
    >>> print(f"Error in simulation is {exact - unmitigated:.{3}}")

    Error in simulation is 0.0506

This shows the impact the noise has had. Let's use ``mitiq`` to improve this
performance.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from mitiq import execute_with_zne

    >>> mitigated = execute_with_zne(circ, noisy_simulation)
    >>> print(f"Error in simulation is {exact - mitigated:.{3}}")
    >>> print("Mitigation provides " \
    >>>  f"a {(exact - unmitigated) / (exact - mitigated):.{3}}" \
    >>>  "factor of improvement.")

    Error in simulation is 0.000519
    Mitigation provides a 97.6 factor of improvement.

The variance in the mitigated expectation value is now stored in ``var``.

You can also use ``mitiq`` to wrap your backend execution function into an
error-mitigated version.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from mitiq import mitigate_executor

    >>> run_mitigated = mitigate_executor(noisy_simulation)
    >>> mitigated = run_mitigated(circ)
    >>> mitigated

    0.9994810819625853

The default implementation uses Richardson extrapolation to extrapolate the
expectation value to the zero noise limit [1]. ``Mitiq`` comes equipped with other
extrapolation methods as well. Different methods of extrapolation are packaged
into ``Factory`` objects. It is easy to try different ones.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from mitiq.factories import LinearFactory

    >>> fac = LinearFactory(scalars=[1.0, 2.0, 2.5])
    >>> linear = execute_with_zne(circ, noisy_simulation, fac=fac)
    >>> print("Mitigated error with the linear method" \
              f" is {exact - linear:.{3}}")

    Mitigated error with the linear method is 0.00638

You can read more about the ``Factory`` objects that are built into ``mitiq`` and
how to create your own `here <factories.html>`_.

Another key step in zero-noise extrapolation is to choose how your circuit is
transformed to scale the noise. You can read more about the noise scaling
methods built into ``mitiq`` and how to create your
own `here <noise-scaling.html>`_.
