Probabilistic Error Cancellation
*********************************************

Probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) capabilities are currently being added to Mitiq. The :py:mod:`pec` sub-package contains the relative modules. A minimal example of the use of PEC in Mitiq can be found in the :ref:`Getting Started section <pec_getting_started>` of the guide, while more details on the theory and limitation of this technique can be found in
the :ref:`About Error Mitigation <guide_qem_pec>` section.
