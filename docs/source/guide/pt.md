# Pauli Twirling

```{admonition} Warning:
Pauli Twirling in Mitiq is still under construction. This users guide will change in the future
after some utility functions are introduced. 
```

Pauli Twirling (PT) is an noise tailoring technique in which,
in the Mitiq implementation, particularly noisy operations (e.g. CZ and CNOT)
are transformed by independent, random, single-qubit gates inserted into
the circuit such that the effective logical circuit remains unchanged
but the noise is tailored towards stochastic Pauli errors.
For more discussion of the theory of PT, see the section [What is the theory
behind PT?](pt-5-theory.md).
