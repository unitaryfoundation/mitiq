# Pauli Twirling

Pauli Twirling (PT) is an error mitigation technique in which,
in the Mitiq implementation, particularly noisy operations (e.g. CZ and CNOT)
are mitigated by independent, random, single-qubit gates inserted into
the circuit such that the effective logical circuit remains unchanged
but the noise is tailored into stochastic Pauli errors, as opposed to
the Markovian processes that are otherwise dominant.
For more discussion of the theory of PT, see the section [What is the theory
behind PT?](pt-5-theory.md).
