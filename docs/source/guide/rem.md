# Readout-Error Mitigation

Readout-Error Mitigation (REM) is an error mitigation technique in which
inverted transition / confusion matrices are applied to the noisy measurement
results. This technique may also go by other names such as "measurement error
mitigation" or "readout confusion inversion".
For more discussion of the theory of REM, see the section [What is the theory
behind REM?](rem-5-theory.md).
