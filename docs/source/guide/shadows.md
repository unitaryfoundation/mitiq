# Classical Shadows

Classical shadows protocol {cite}`huang2020predicting` aims to create an approximate classical representation
of a quantum state using minimal measurements. The protocol is based on the idea of shadow tomography,
which is a technique for reconstructing a quantum state from a small number of measurements.
This approach not only characterizes and mitigates noise effectively but also retains
sample efficiency and demonstrates noise resilience {cite}`chen2021robust`. For more details, see the section
[Classical Shadow Protocol and its Robust Estimation](shadows-5-theory.md).
