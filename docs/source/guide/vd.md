# Virtual Distillation

Virtual Distillation (VD) is an error mitigation technique in which multiple copies of a quantum state are utilized to filter out noise and enhance the signal of the desired eigenstate. 
By combining measurements from these copies in a specific way, Virtual Distillation can effectively reduce the impact of decoherence and other noise sources in quantum computations (see the section on the theory behind Virtual Distillation).
