# Zero Noise Extrapolation

Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is an error mitigation technique in which an expectation
value is computed at different noise levels and, as a second step, the ideal
expectation value is inferred by extrapolating the measured results to the zero-noise
limit (see the section [What is the theory behind ZNE?](zne-5-theory.myst)).

Here are some examples on how to use ZNE in Mitiq:

- [Zero-noise extrapolation with Pennylane on IBMQ backends](../examples/pennylane-ibmq-backends.myst)
- [Zero-noise extrapolation with Braket on the IonQ backend](../examples/zne-braket-ionq.myst)
- [Zero-noise extrapolation of the energy landscape of a variational circuit with Cirq on a simulator](../examples/simple-landscape-cirq.myst)

You can find many more in the **[Examples](../examples/examples.myst)** section of the documentation.
