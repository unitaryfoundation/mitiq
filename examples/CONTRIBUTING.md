Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated, every little bit helps.

## Adding an example
This repository contains example notebooks of use of Mitiq, such as to reproduce research results from the literature.


### Style Guidelines

General Mitiq code style guidelines apply also to notebooks, please see the [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) best practices.

For Jupyter notebooks, an additional effort is requested in interspersing code blocks with comments in markdown, as well as running the
```bash
from mitiq import about
about()
```
at the end of the tutorial.
