    """Function for the calculation of an observable from some circuit of
    interest to be mitigated with CDR (or vnCDR) based on [Czarnik2020]_ and
    [Lowe2020]_.

    The circuit of interest must be compiled in the native basis of the IBM
    quantum computers, that is {Rz, sqrt(X), CNOT}, or such that all the
    non-Clifford gates are contained in the Rz rotations.

    The observable/s to be calculated should be input as an array or a list of
    arrays representing the diagonal of the observables to be measured. Note
    these observables MUST be diagonal in z-basis measurements corresponding to
    the circuit of interest.

    Returns mitigated observables list of raw observables (at noise scale
    factors).

    This function returns the mitigated observable/s.
    Args:
        circuit: Circuit of interest compiled in the correct basis.
        executor: User defined function taking a cirq Circuit object and
                  returning a dictionary of counts.
        simulator: User defined function taking a cirq Circuit object and
                   returning either a simulated dictionary of counts or an
                   np.ndarray representing the state vector.
        observables: List of arrays containing the diagonal elements of
                    observable/s of interest to be mitigated. If a list is
                    passed all these observables will be mitigates with the
                    same training set.
        num_training_circuits: Number of training circuits to be used in the
                               mitigation.
        fraction_non_clifford: The fraction of non-Clifford gates to be
                               subsituted in the training circuits. The higher
                               this fraction the more costly the simulations,
                               but more successful the mitigation.
        fit_function: The function to map noisy to exact data. Takes array of
                      noisy and data and parameters returning a float.
        num_fit_parameters: The number of paramters the fit_function takes.
        scale_noise: Optional argument containing a user defined function on
                     how to increase the noise. If this argument is given then
                     the mitigation method will be vnCDR.
        scale_factors: Factors by which to scale the noise, should not
                               include 1 as this is just the original circuit.
        kwargs: Available keyword arguments are:

        TRAINING SET CONSTRUCTION OPTIONS:

            - method_select (string): Specifies the method used to select the
                                      non-Clifford gates to replace when
                                      constructing the near-Clifford training
                                      circuits. Available options are:
                                            ['uniform', 'gaussian']
            - method_replace (string): Specifies the method used to replace the
                                      selected non-Clifford gates with a
                                      Clifford when constructing the
                                      near-Clifford training circuits.
                                      Available options are:
                                        ['uniform', 'gaussian', 'closest']
            - sigma_select (float): Width of the Gaussian distribution used for
                                    ``method_select='gaussian'``.
            - sigma_replace (float): Width of the Gaussian distribution used
                                     for ``method_replace='gaussian'``.
            - random_state (int): Seed for sampling.

    Returns: The tuple (cdr_values, cdr_raw_data) corresponding
             to the mitigated expectation values and to the raw expectation
             values (at different noise levels).
