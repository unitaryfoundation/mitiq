    """Evaluates the expectation value associated to the input circuit
    using probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) [Temme2017]_.

    This function implements PEC by:

    1. Sampling different implementable circuits from the quasi-probability
       representation of the input circuit;
    2. Evaluating the noisy expectation values associated to the sampled
       circuits (through the "executor" function provided by the user);
    3. Estimating the ideal expectation value from a suitable linear
       combination of the noisy ones.

    Args:
        circuit: The input circuit to execute with error-mitigation.
        executor: A function which executes a circuit and returns an
            expectation value.
        decomposition_dict: The decomposition dictionary containing the
            quasi-probability representation of the ideal operations (those
            which are part of the input circuit).
        num_samples: The number of noisy circuits to be sampled for PEC.
            If equal to None, it is deduced from the amount of "negativity"
            of the quasi-probability representation of the input circuit.
            Note: the latter feature is not yet implemented and num_samples
            is just set to 1000 if not specified.
        random_state: Seed for sampling circuits.
        full_output: If False only the average PEC value is returned.
            If True an estimate of the associated error is returned too.

    Returns:
        pec_value: The PEC estimate of the ideal expectation value associated
            to the input circuit.
        pec_error: The estimated error between the mitigated 'pec_value' and
            the actual ideal expectation value. This is estimated as the ratio
            pec_std / sqrt(num_samples), where 'pec_std' is the
            standard deviation of the PEC samples, i.e., the square root of
            the mean squared deviation of the sampled values from 'pec_value'.
            This is returned only if 'full_output' is True.
