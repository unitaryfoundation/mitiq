    Based on the number of copies of the original circuit,
    the diagonalizing gate is a num_copies-qubit gate
    that is applied N times where N is the amount of
    qubits in the original circuit.
    The diagonalizing gate is applied as follows:
    first apply the gate to qubit 1 of copy 1,
        qubit 1 of copy 2, ..., qubit 1 of copy num_copies.
    second apply the gate to qubit 2 of copy 1,
